# HealthApp
The project is about health parameter monitoring system enabling the reading, storage, and presentation of data. The system is composed of specialized biomedical sensors for measuring vital signs and a web application for presenting data collected from these sensors. The project is focus on frontend development in Angular and TypeScript, backend development in Express.js,  hardwwre development in Arduino ecosystem (C).
